## Lessons Learned
<p>
It's been some time since I've picked up a personal project, but I had the great opportunity to build the website for the church I was attending which is Emmanuel Church of Philadelphia. This wasn't necessarily my first time working with a client and doing this type of freelancing work, but it was an awesome opportunity to be able to test my skills and build a website that would be used live and be on the frontlines of interaction made with the church.
</p>
<p>
The website was overall quite standard, but it was my first time trying to make a site as simple, clean, and appealing all at the same time. In the past, I've always tried to make the websites I created using all the fancy packages and animations I could - to make it as unique as possible, but this time around, I was to stick to a design that engaged the user with a design that makes the user feel as if the design didn't exist in a sense. It was to be seamless and pleasing to the eyes. I worked in Figma and communicated with the client in iterations which was an awesome experience - it felt much like I was getting into freelance work. I do think this project overall was not just a way to test my technical skillset, but also my communication with clients as well as giving me a stronger understanding of where I would like to take my skillset in the future. Freelancing for churches and being able to help the communities with a skillset I originally thought was difficult to incorporate in a volunteering sense, made me more passionate to pursue higher heights.
